# Greetings!

I am Plazma, a graphic designer, learning programmer, and a bit of an idiot.

## Projects
I usually get the idea for a project, make it here, then forget about it. I'm slowly trying to learn a number of programming languages to try and get them going, but with school and such it's hard..
